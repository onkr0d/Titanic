      # This step uses [docker/metadata-action](https://github.com/docker/metadata-action#about) to extract tags and labels that will be applied to the specified image. The `id` "meta" allows the output of this step to be referenced in a subsequent step. The `images` value provides the base name for the tags and labels.
      # lowkey all metadata extraction is used for attestation, but attest isn't supported in private user owned repo. could be something to come back to later
